\chapter{Introduction}

In England and Wales the percentage of students choosing to study a GCSE in computer science rose by 50\% from 2015 to 2016 and continued to rise between 2016 and 2017 \cite{ofqual}. This is according to official statistics published by Ofqual.

Combined with government aims to introduce simple programming to children as young as five years old, this suggests that more and more young people are beginning to produce code.

This project does not aim to convince the reader that five year old require a source control system, however for students at GCSE age, and for ALevel students, both of whom are completing projects involving non-trivial amounts of code, the need for comprehensive backups and version control become more apparent.

In the field of computer science, this is a solved problem. The \emph{Git} source control solves all these problems, providing means of easily backing up code, keeping track of versions and enabling rolling ba
