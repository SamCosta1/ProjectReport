This report discusses a project aimed to bring version-control to children through a simplified interface to the Git version-control system. An argument that such software is needed will be presented, and the design and implementation of the software discussed. This will include a discussion of how the system was split into distinct components and the individual challenges involved in implementing these components. We will discuss the testing strategy, both in terms of automated testing and the use of focus groups to obtain real user feedback. Finally, this report reflects on the achievements of the project and comments on decisions that would be made differently if the project restarted.
